# Markup-Tag-Evaluation

Markup-Tag-Evaluation implements metrics to evaluate hypothesized markup tag placements in a sentence against reference tag placement in the same sentence.

The metrics assume that each tag of the reference appears exactly once in the hypothesis. 
Chapter 3 of the paper [Automatic Bilingual Markup Transfer](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.299/) provides a detailed description of the evaluation metrics.
